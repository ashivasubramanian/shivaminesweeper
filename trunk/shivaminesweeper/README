ShivaMinesweeper is a project written by me, Shivasubramanian A
(http://ashivasubramanian.blogspot.com) to enhance/showcase my skills in Java,
J2EE and Ruby technologies. Feel free to send across any bouquets as well as
brickbats as I am very much interested in increasing my coding skills.

HOW TO SETUP SHIVAMINESWEEPER:
Currently, the application is coded using Java/J2EE and hence the steps
described below are for deployment into a J2EE server:

1) Download the file, mine_release0.2.zip from the site.
2) To deploy the project to your server, use the ant deploy command. However,
the project supports only Apache Tomcat web server.
3) Use the URL, http://localhost:8080/mine/ to access the application.
