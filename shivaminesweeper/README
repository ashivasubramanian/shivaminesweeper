ShivaMinesweeper is a project written by me, Shivasubramanian A
(http://ashivasubramanian.blogspot.com) to enhance/showcase my skills in Java,
J2EE and Ruby technologies. Feel free to send across any bouquets as well as
brickbats as I am very much interested in increasing my coding skills.

HOW TO SETUP SHIVAMINESWEEPER:
Currently, the application is coded using Java/J2EE and hence the steps
described below are for deployment into a J2EE server:

1) Download the file, mine_release0.2.zip from the site.
2) To deploy the project to your server, use the ant deploy command. I developed this
application on Apache Tomcat and hence the ant task assumes Tomcat deployment.
If you are trying to deploy to a different server, then use the server's GUI to 
deploy the JAR file or reference the server's documentation.
3) Use the URL, http://localhost:8080/mine/ to access the application.
